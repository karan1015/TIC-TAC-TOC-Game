Tic Tac Toe Game
-----------------
A simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game built with Python. Two players can play the game in turns, and the game checks for a win or draw condition after each move.

How to Play
------------
- Player 1 is **X** and Player 2 is **O**.
- The game will prompt you to enter the row and column to place your mark.
- The game board is a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns to place their mark in an empty cell.
- The first player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the board is full without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
